I got a BSc in Computing at the University of the West of England back in 2023. 

My name is Alen and I am programmer who works with languages like C, and C++ and Python (when required).
I have experience in MySQL databases and and building webpages using PHP and Flask.

I enjoy programming, 3D printing, playing games (when I have the time), collecting old lighters, and more.

This site is both my CV and a space to showcase projects I've undertaken or currently working on, and one off posts in unrelated fields.
