Welcome to my website, it is unfinished.

My name is Alen or Alenas depending if you are in Lithuania, and I am programmer who likes statically typed languages like C, and C++.
I have experience in MySQL databases and and building webpages using PHP and Flask.

I enjoy programming, 3D printing, playing games (when I have the time), collecting old lighters, and more.

This site is both my CV and a space to showcase projects I've undertaken or currently working on, and one off posts in unrelated fields.
